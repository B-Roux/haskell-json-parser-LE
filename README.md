Making a JSON parser seems to be the "hello world" of learning functional programming, and I am not one to break with such traditions!

This is my first ever Haskell program, and I am embarking on it solely as a learning experience. There are bound to be bugs and inefficient usage of features, so *please do not use this if your goal is to actually parse JSON!* If, however, you are like me and you want to use this project as a cheat-sheet while learning, feel free to spend as much time as you like browsing my probably terrible code!

If you find any bugs in this project you can submit an issue about it. I might get around to fixing it, but since this is a learning excercise, this will not be a priority for me.

Again, this is the first time I've ever written Haskell. Please don't use this code in a serious setting unless you've thuroughly vetted it. *Please.*
