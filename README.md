As a first project in learning functional programming, I decided that it would be fun to try building a JSON parser! The idea is that I would eventually write *two* parsers: The first will be written as I am just getting my feet wet with Haskell to establish some baseline, and then some time later I will write a second parser that will hopefully show improvements and growth when compared to the first!

As of right now, only the first of these has been written and it can be found in the [august22](./august22/) file.

This is my first ever program in Haskell. Please don't actually use this to parse JSON, there are a million-and-one libraries better suited to this purpose. This program is purely for education (mostly my own) and entertainment (motly my own). I am making this repo public so that others who might want to explore it and either *learn from* or *laugh at* it can do so to their heart's content. Don't ever actually use it in the real world, however. Lastly, NO BUGS WILL BE FIXED, EVER. As I said previously, the purpose of this project is to gauge my growth and see how much my ability to solve this problem improves as I learn more about functional programming in general and Haskell in particular.

Thank you - enjoy your stay!
